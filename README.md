# ReaConfig

ReaConfig is an application for working with Reaper configs. Enables the user to:
- Stores any number of Reaper configs -- these can either be directories, or git repos.
- Make any one config active at a given time (by symlinking it to the appropriate location).
<!-- TODO: -->
<!-- - Merge any two configs. -->
- Backup the currently-active config (including the stock one) if it's not already.
