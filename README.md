# ReaConfig

ReaConfig is an application for working with Reaper configs. Still in early development.

Features/roadmap:
- IN PROGRESS: Make any one config active at a given time (by symlinking it to the appropriate location).
- TODO: Backup the currently-active config (including the stock one) if it's not already.
- TODO: Stores any number of Reaper configs -- these can either be directories, or git repos.
- TODO: Merge any two configs.
